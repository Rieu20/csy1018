          <h1>Reflection</h1>
          <p>The aim of this assigment is to demonstrate the ability of developing a Responsive User Interphase design system for users producing conclusive principles of current trends with the innovation and possibility of technology that allows a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. Mobile principles are fundamental, but touch, voice, mouse, and keyboard are all ﬁrst-class input methods.

            My overall experience was intimidating as a beginner learning coding languages in web development module using HTML5 and CSS3. I felt very uncomfortable and lost during the first 3 weeks. 
            However, with the help, support and resources available on NILE, combined with support sessions from (Teaching Assistant Andrew and Module tutor Liz) I was able develop and improve my coding skill.</p>
          <p>Another helpful approach I took upon my self was making sure I watch the tutorial video’s uploaded by my module tutor weekly. The introduction of flex box helped me a great lot after going through the flex froggy game on NILE. I learnt a whole lot on how to display flex with my layout, positioning, navigating and aligning items.</p>
          <p> My project was to build a current ‘User Interface design’ based on current design trends as exhibited on Google Material Design approach creating 6 web pages with technical scripting skills such as the designing, usability, navigations and testing the code.</p>
          <p>After an extensive research on how to start the project, together with help and support it all started fallen into place. 
            I eventually created my six web pages using the syntax of HTML and CSS with a new updated trending application called THIMBLE by MOZILLA 
            https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-GB/
            <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-GB/">thimble.mozilla</a>
            Thimble is an online code editor I found very effective and easy to use when creating your personal web page, as its accessible to view, edit, and check your projects at any time or place once connected through the net. 
            This current trending application has helped me learn different features to design, structure and edit my project.</p>

          <p>Another useful web developer tool I used with my team mates was Code pen
         <a href=" https://codepen.io/<a">codepen.io</a>
          <p>
            With the application there are wide variety of pen designs, layout structure, colour palette and updated features to choose from.
            Code pen allows a designer to pick a pen, give credit to it by liking then to fork the selection u choose and edit to have a real view of its desired effect for your use.
          The advantage in using Code pen is that it enables you change elements and solve numerous problems with your code, layout and design</p>

           Google font was also used which has different font options to explore, sort and test. There where new font I tested based on its popularity and trends on other different web pages I researched</p>
          <p>Overall, I have had a rough start which caused me a lot of stress week by week, not even having good Christmas holiday because of all the work load. 
            Having difficulty with the media query code, goodness me creating and restarting the whole project multiple times.  As I had to create different projects on thimble to make sure I get to a standard of demonstrating my skills and technique for a responsive user interface design.</p>
          <p> But eventually I took onboard all the resources, support that was available to conclude and create a responsive website. It was quite an experience that left me tearful some days, but I later enjoyed single minute of it. Enjoyed doing the coding, structuring and altering my layout </p>
          <p>Wireframing is a vital step for any screen design process. It mainly allows the designer to outline the information order of the design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information </p>
