          <h1>Morals of Good Practise</h1>
          <p>MGP in user interface design are the standard web conventions or rules that web designers followed. As we are in the 21st century tools , technology, design, and layout have changed.  </p>
          <h2>Material Design</h2>
          <p>Material design could be refered to as a collective system that combines theory resources, and tools for creating digital experiences  </p>
          <p>Design is the art of non-stop problem solving—a dynamic cycle of exploring and validating needs, creating and evolving ideas, and solutions. Over the course of its life, a digital product is designed by many hands. The things of this teamwork can be seen in the quality of a product’s identity and implementation, as well as in the strength of the community it builds.</p>

          </p>
          <p>There were various principles of material design I took into consideration designing my website to develop a fundamental system that allows a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. Mobile precepts are fundamental, but touch, voice, mouse, and keyboard are all ﬁrst-class input methods.</p>
          <p>Below are a list of key principles my self and team mate find current as morals of good practice for any standard web design</p>
